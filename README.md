## Course Information

| **Field** | **Details** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Course Code** | CSS121P |
| **Course Title** | Computer Programming 1 |
| **Prerequisite** | None |
| **Co-Requisite** | None |
| **Credit** | 3 units (2-unit lecture, 1-unit laboratory) |

## Course Description

This course focuses on the logic formulation in solving simple computing problems. This course covers the primitive and abstract data types, programming construct and the coding principles both in syntax and semantics using a structured language. This course has a computer laboratory component for hands-on activities that support and reinforce the concepts discussed.

## Course Outcomes

After completing the course, the student must demonstrate the following outcomes:

1. Understand and apply the concepts of flowchart and pseudocode in designing the program
2. Understand the coding principles with the use of programming language techniques
3. Develop programs using variables, data types, control structure, functions, Arrays, pointers and dynamic arrays and string functions

## Course Evaluation

### Grade Calculator

To help students track their progress throughout the semester, a grade calculator tool is available that allows you to:
- Input your scores for each assessment task
- Calculate your current standing in both lecture and laboratory components
- Project what scores you need on remaining assessments to achieve your target grade
- Monitor your progress toward meeting the 70% minimum requirement for satisfactory performance

Students are encouraged to use this calculator regularly to stay informed about their academic standing and plan their study efforts accordingly.
